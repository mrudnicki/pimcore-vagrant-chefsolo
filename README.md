# Pimcore Vagrant project

## Requirements

* Vagrant: [Go to the download page](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
* Virtualbox: [Here you can download it](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

**Windows users:** 
To optimize performance, Windows users should install the vagrant plugin. 
Just use the command: `vagrant plugin install vagrant-winnfsd` in cmd

## Installation

* In a terminal go to VagrantFile directory
* Find the configuration file example in: `configuration_example/vagrant/chef/cookbooks/pimcore/attributes/default.rb` and copy it to the `chef/cookbooks/pimcore/attributes` directory (you can also change default values, for example `server_name`).
* Note that you can configure many Pimcore instances
* type: `vagrant up` (you can also just open this project in PHPstorm and use vagrant up command)

If you're using this vagrant box a first time it can take around 15 minutes. 

## It's ready

Ok the environment is ready to use

* Mysql, Nginx, php-fpm installed and configured
* every package required by Pimcore installed
* You can specify more than one Pimcore project in the configuration file. Array `default["hosts"]` keeps information about virtual hosts.
 
 
Type `vagrant ssh`

If you're Mac or Linux user now you're connected via ssh to VM
Windows user has to use returned value in Putty or an other ssh client
